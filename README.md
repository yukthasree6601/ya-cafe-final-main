# Zwiggato

Zwiggato is a restaurant discovery app built using React, designed to showcase restaurants based on your location. This project leverages Swiggy's live API, enabling a seamless user experience with a config-driven UI inspired by Akshay Saini's **Namaste React** series.

- **Lazy Loading**: Optimizes performance by loading components only when needed.
- **Custom Hooks**: Used for modularity and reusability of code.
- **Shimmer UI**: Adds a skeleton loading effect for a smoother UX.
- **Config-driven UI**: Adaptable and easily customizable, making use of configuration data.
- **State Management**: Managed using Redux Toolkit for scalable state handling.
- **CORS Proxy Server**: Solves cross-origin issues by using a CORS proxy server.
